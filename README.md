üß¨ TRPV1 RNA-seq Analysis Scripts

Bulk RNA-seq data analysis and visualization pipeline
These R scripts were used to analyze murine RNA-seq datasets ‚Äî including normalization, differential expression (DESeq2), PCA, and functional enrichment (clusterProfiler).

All scripts are annotated and commented to support understanding and reproducibility, especially for medical researchers without extensive programming experience.

üìÇ Contents
	‚Ä¢	DESeq2 normalization & DEG identification
For processing raw count data and identifying differentially expressed genes.

	‚Ä¢	PCA analysis, heatmap, VENN, beeswarm scripts
For visualizing sample clustering and group separation.

	‚Ä¢	Functional enrichment (GO & KEGG)
Using clusterProfiler and Enrichr for pathway interpretation.

	‚Ä¢	Visualization scripts
For generating publication-ready plots (volcano plots, dotplots, etc.).

Bioconductor packages: DESeq2, clusterProfiler, org.Mm.eg.db, enrichR, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, etc.
(Exact package usage is documented in each script header, if published they need to be cited !! use citation())
